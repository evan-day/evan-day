### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer by day for C.H Robinson. By night, I'm an avid self hoster and cloud computing enthusiast. I run multiple services off of a remote server, with a handful more running at home. I talk about it a lot on my [blog](https://evanday.com) so feel free to check that out!

### The Contribution Chart

Not that I put much worth in these charts anymore, but my one probably looks slightly less green than previous years, that's just because I now self host my own instance of Gitlab! Told you I was an avid self hoster :)
