### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer by day for C.H Robinson. By night, I'm an avid self hoster and cloud computing enthusiast. I run multiple services off of a remote server, with a handful more running at home. I talk about it a lot on my [blog](https://evanday.com) so feel free to check that out!
