# Its Me!

I'm a 26 year old, born, living and working in Ireland. I am a massive nerd and I find myself in the wonderful space where my work is my hobby. 

## What I Do
- My title with my current company, C.H. Robinson, is DevOps Software Engineer III, who I have been working with for almost two years now.
- While our overall group is responsible for DevOps based activities within the company, my direct work involves being the technical lead for the infrastructure team within DevOps.
- We have been on a mission of stabilisation and improving our overall infrastructure footprint within DevOps, predominately on cloud with Microsoft Azure but also interacting with our on premises footprint.

## My Interests
- Self Hosting
	- I really enjoy learning and expanding my skills. Self Hosting is a great way for me to do that by running new software and writing services that extend that software to better enhance my life.
- Formula 1
	- Cars go nyoooom!
- Gaming
	- Have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free with no restrictions on playtime.
- Coffee

## Favourite things in tech
- Kubernetes
	- I started my career with Kubernetes, so it will always have a special place in my heart. It is probably one of the few pieces of software I understand throughout in terms of how it works.
- Cloud Computing
	- Been using cloud in some shape or form for eight years so I quite enjoy it. Still have my favourites when it comes to specific providers. Ultimately once they implement your chosen layer of abstraction, that should be all that matters. Lest they prove to be highly unreliable.
